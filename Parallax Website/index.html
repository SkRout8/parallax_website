            The best way to define India's climate is in terms of a yearly
            seasonal cycle. The cold weather season, the hot weather season, the
            southwest monsoon season, and the retreating monsoon season are the
            four seasons, according to meteorologists. The Seasons of India are
            majorly classified as Summer, Winter, Autumn, Spring and Monsoon
            seasons.

          <p id="text">
            Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after
            spring and before autumn. At or centred on the summer solstice,
            daylight hours are longest and darkness hours are shortest, with day
            length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.The
            earliest sunrises and latest sunsets also occur near the date of the
            solstice.<br />
            <br />
            The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate,
            tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern
            Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.

            The wet season is the time of year when most of a region's average
            annual rainfall occurs. Generally, the season lasts at least a
            month. <br />
            <br />The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by
            tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across
            portions of the tropics and subtropics.

            Autumn is usually defined in the Northern Hemisphere as the period
            between the autumnal equinox (day and night equal in length),
            September 22 or 23, and the winter solstice (year's shortest day),
            December 21 or 22; and in the Southern Hemisphere as the period
            between March 20 or 21 and June 21 or 22. <br />

            The Indian summer monsoon typically lasts from June-September (Fig.
            58d), with large areas of western and central India receiving more
            than 90% of their total annual precipitation during the period, and
            southern and northwestern India receiving 50%-75% of their total
            annual rainfall.<br />

          <p id="text">
            Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate
            climates. It occurs after autumn and before spring. The tilt of
            Earth's axis causes seasons; winter occurs when a hemisphere is
            oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different
            dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on
            weather. <br />

            Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate
            seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various
            technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies
            according to local climate, cultures and customs.<br />
